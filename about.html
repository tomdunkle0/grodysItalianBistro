                    Anthony "Tony" Pascarelli is the Owner and Head Chef of Grody's Italian Bistro.
                    Tony has been awarded the Boughton Culture & Quality Award at the Danbury
                    Street Festival for the years 2015, 2019, and 2022.
                    <br><br>
                    Tony was born and raisedx in Metuchen, NJ. He learned to cook from sharing the
                    kitchen with his grandfarther, Giuseppe "Grody" Pascarelli. a 2 time applicant
                    at Little Fox Kitchen.  Tony decided to take his cooking professional in the
                    "BIG APPLE" in 2008
                    <br><br>
                    After his first two restaurants (Tony's Pies in Brooklyn & Giuraddio in
                    Manhattan) flopped: Tony took an MTA train up to Danbury, Connecticut to visit
                    his coussin. Tony realized that Danbury was the perfect-o town for the next BIG
                    Italian sensation.  so there he opened Grody's Italian Bistro in 2013, and the
                    REST is HISTORY!!

                    Sergio Bagali is the Head Server and Assistant Manager at Grody's Italian
                    Bistro. Sergio was born and raised in Citt√† della Pieve, Umbria, Italy. When
                    he was six years old, Sergio's family emigrated to Connecticut so that Sergio's
                    father could work as an accountant.
                    <br><br>
                    Sergio was studying to be an accountant himself. But, he stopped doing that
                    crap to come work with me when I opened Grody's. It did him some good, and he's
                    a good guy. Sergio's expertese in costomer service is what made me decide to
                    bring him on. I worked with him briefly in the waste management industry here
                    in Connecticut before we opened the restaurant togerther.

                    full-time member of the team since the restaurant's opening in 2013, Marcos has
                    always shown dedication and a work ethic that the rest of the team can rely on.
                    Marcos grew up right here in Danbury, Connecticut. He's one of our own!
                    <br><br>
                    This guy right here, he taught me everything I know about clearing tables. That
                    was one thing my Dad never taught me. That's why I keep Marcos around. He's a
                    clown but we love him. If you want a photo with Marcos, just say the word.
